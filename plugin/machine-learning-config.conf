# OWASP CRS Plugin
# Plugin name: machine-learning
# Plugin description: This plugin serves to add a machine learning integration support to the CRS.
# Rule ID block base: 9,516,000 - 9,516,999
# Plugin version: 1.0.0

# Documentation can be found here:
# https://github.com/coreruleset/machine-learning-integration-plugin

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the machine-learning-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# tx.machine-learning-plugin_enabled=0.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
#SecRule &TX:machine-learning-plugin_enabled "@eq 0" \
#  "id:9516010,\
#   phase:1,\
#   pass,\
#   nolog,\
#   setvar:'tx.machine-learning-plugin_enabled=0'"

# The Machine Learning plugin can be configured to run in 2 modes.
# machine-learning-plugin_mode=1 means it will run in "false positive detection mode. 
# This mode will help reduce the number of false positives.
# machine-learning-plugin_mode=2 means it will run in "detection and training mode". 
# inbound_ml_status by default is set to 0. 
# This will be updated by the Machine Learning model and then compared to the pass or deny flag.
# machine-learning-plugin_inbound_ml_pass_flag = 1 is initialized against which the decision to pass is made.
# machine-learning-plugin_inbound_ml_deny_flag = 0 is initialized against which the decision to deny is made.
